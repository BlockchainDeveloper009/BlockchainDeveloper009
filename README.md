- :) last but least, I also develop web based UI to connect to contracts on testnets using tools such as 
      
       Frontend Tools       : "ethers.js | web3modal | wagmi | mantine | chakraui | rainbowkit"
       Languages            : "Solidity | Typescript | SQL | GRAPHQL | Rust Beginner | Python Beginner"
       Framework            : "Nextjs | Hardhat | Foundry"

       Scaling Solutions    : "ZK-Rollup"
       Query Blockcain      : "GrapQL protocol"
       CI/CD                : "AWS | AZURE | VERCEL | GIT"
       DATABASE             : "MONGODB | MSSQL | POSTGRE"
       TESTING Lib/Frame    : "CHAI | NUNIT | PLAYWRIGHT"
       Protcols             : "Openzepplin ERC20 | ERC1155 | ERC721"

  Project c: Inherit Blocks
              this smart contract is written on top of ERC20 to allow users to save their assets(for now crypto) and set a future date, when 
              system reaches that date, using chainlink, smart contract will settle the amount to Benefitor automatically.

  Project b: Treasury Bonds creation using ERC1155 - allows Bond Managers to create new bonds and sell them in market. Bond Buyers can select suitable bond,                   redeem whenver necessary before deadline.
