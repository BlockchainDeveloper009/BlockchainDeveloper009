- 👋 Hi, I’m Harish G Krishnamurthy
- 👀 I’m interested in building Blockchain Apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on personal Defi projects - Debonds, write smart contracts (ERC20, ERC721, ERC 3475) using Solidity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Hackathons, Build Defi & NFT projects.
- 📫 How to reach me twitter: @harrypks19 and linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hari-g-krishna-a69846229/
- :) last but least, I also develop web based UI to connect to contracts on testnets using tools such as 
       "ethers.js | web3modal | wagmi | mantis | chakraui | rainbowkit"

  Project d: Create new Blockchain similar to Bitcoin

  Project c: Inherit Blocks
              this smart contract is written on top of ERC20 to allow users to save their assets(for now crypto) and set a future date, when 
              system reaches that date, using chainlink, smart contract will settle the amount to Benefitor automatically.
