- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Harish G Krishnamurthy
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in building Decentralized Apps & Blockchain Protocol.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently working on personal Defi projects - Debonds, write smart contracts (ERC20, ERC721, ERC 3475) using Solidity.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on Hackathons, Build Defi & NFT projects.

- :) last but least, I also develop web based UI to connect to contracts on testnets using tools such as 
      ```
       Frontend Tools       : "ethers.js | web3modal | wagmi | mantine | chakraui | rainbowkit"
       Languages            : "Solidity | Typescript | SQL | GRAPHQL | Rust | Python basics"
       Framework            : "Nextjs | Hardhat | Foundry"
       Distributed Systems  : "RESTAPi | AXIOS "
       Scaling Solutions    : "ZK-Rollup"
       Query Blockcain      : "GrapQL protocol"
       CI/CD                : "AWS | AZURE | VERCEL | GIT"
       DATABASE             : "MONGODB | MSSQL | POSTGRE"
       TESTING Lib/Frame    : "CHAI | NUNIT | PLAYWRIGHT"
       Protcols             : "Openzepplin ERC20 | ERC1155 | ERC721"
       Rpc tools            : "Alchemy | Infura | IPFS | ThirdWeb"
     ```

  Project d: Create new Blockchain similar to Bitcoin. Using Blockchain bulding blocks like Cryptography | Consensus Algorithm | Peer-to-Peer | Distributed                    mechanism
              [Github Repo](https://github.com/BlockchainDeveloper009/defi_blockchain_bitcoin_network_js.git)

  Project c: Inherit Blocks
              this smart contract is written on top of ERC20 to allow users to save their assets(for now crypto) and set a future date, when 
              system reaches that date, using chainlink, smart contract will settle the amount to Benefitor automatically.
              [Github Repo](https://github.com/BlockchainDeveloper009/defi_inheritBlocks_aave_cl_hd_ts)
  
  Project b: Treasury Bonds creation using ERC1155 - allows Bond Managers to create new bonds and sell them in market. Bond Buyers can select suitable bond,                   redeem whenver necessary before deadline.
